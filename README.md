## Beautiful Soup
Beautiful Soup is a Python library for getting data out of HTML, XML, and other markup languages. Say you’ve found some webpages that display data relevant to your research, such as date or address information, but that do not provide any way of downloading the data directly. Beautiful Soup helps you pull particular content from a webpage, remove the HTML markup, and save the information. It is a tool for web scraping that helps you clean up and parse the documents you have pulled down from the web.
### Installing Beautiful Soup
Installing Beautiful Soup is easiest if you have pip or another Python installer already in place.
```sh
pip install beautifulsoup4
```
You may need to preface this line with “sudo”, which gives your computer permission to write to your root directories and requires you to re-enter your password. This is the same logic behind you being prompted to enter your password when you install a new program.

With sudo, the command is:
```sh
sudo pip install beautifulsoup4
```
